# Class 5 - E-textiles and Wearables

31th October  2017

This class focuses on exploring how we can produce soft circuits and sensors, to embed them into garments and wearables, using soft circuits and soft actuators.
We will start with an overview of materials, components, tools and projects.

** Program outline **

- Introduction
- why soft, why embedding
- [conductive materials](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?cat=24)
  - threads
  - fabrics
  - inks
- [hard soft connections](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=1272)
  - Machine-sewable Hard/Soft Connections
  - crimp beads
  - Perfboard/Conductive thread
  - Metal machine popper/Conductive fabric
  - Hand sewable metal popper/Conductive thread
  - Wire/Conductive fabric (soldering)
  - Wire/Conductive thread (soldering)
- [actuators](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?cat=28)
  - shape memory alloy
  - fabric speakers
  - flip dot & flapping wing
- [soft sensors](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?cat=26)
  - pressure sensor
  - joystick
  - stroke
  - accelerometer
  - switches
  - stretch sensors
  - potentiometers

** Materials **

** Machines/tools **

- soldering station
- solder tin
- embroidery 
- sewing machine
- hand stitching

** Assignment **

The students will have to produce one soft sensor experimenting with the materials available at the lab. Trying to reproduce the same sensor with different materials/techniques (hard/hard hard/soft soft/soft).

** How will it be evaluated? **

- Student has built on or more soft sensors, using different materials and techniques
- Student has provided necessary documentation to replicate the project
- Source files available for download
