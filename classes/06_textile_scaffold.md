# Class 6 - The Textile Scaffold

07-11-2017

Global instructor: Anastasia Pistofidou

Technical textiles have various applications, among which agrotech, building, clothes, geotech, sports. In this class we will use textiles for composites, polymerisation, solidification, fabric formwork, crystallization, composites and biocomposites, agglomerates.

This class focuses on exploring techniques and applications of technical textiles in the industry. It introduces the concept of designing custom processes that require the design of a set of tools, processes and workflow.

**Program outline** 

Technical Textile applications 
- Composites 
- Biocomposites 
- Krystallization 
- Fabric formwork & Concrete or Plaster Casting Wood 
- Textile Composite

**Materials**

-Bio Resin and Resin 
-Borax, Rochelle salt, Potasium sodium, Epsom Salt, Sugar, 
-Concrete and 
-Plaster 
-Veneer Wood 
-Fabric 
-White Glue 
-Vacuum bags  
-vacuum machine

**Assignment**

Each student can use a different technique to make a prototype of a technical textile application

For this assignment you will require to build up your tools (container for molding, vacuum bag set up, frames, matrix, recipients) and process for your workflow.You can use any machine of the fab lab, laser cutter, 3D printer, CNC milling or make it manually. Tip: Give special importance to 3D dimensional geometries you are making and the technique you are using to create them.

You need to make ¨coupons¨, samples of your composite with standard dimensions : 13x17cm minimum and maximum 40x40cm. Either flat or formed on a 3D dimensional surface.

**How will it be evaluated?**

-Documentation on webpage and physical prototype. 
-Record the process and make a stop motion.
