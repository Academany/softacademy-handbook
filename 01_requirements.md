# New and aspiring sites: Basic requirements

## Basic Requirements for Soft Academy Participation

Here are the basic requirements and expectations for any lab that wishes to participate in the the Soft Academy course.

Your lab MUST be equipped with the ALL necessary machines and other supplies to be able to participate in the Academy. Labs that are not properly equipped are not eligible to participate in the Academy, as the students will not be able to complete the course.

As this is a bleeding edge program, and inventory specification is continually being updated. For the most up-to-date list of recommended machines and supplies, see: the [Soft Academy Lab Inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvBthCZPWZrIqn_Ew0iTUXM_QmK9HLjZkhyg8D-4SXM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Necessary Equipment 
Bold is mandatory

- **3D Printer / Laser cutter / Molding and casting/ cnc milling / materials / Composites / Electronics equipment**
- Basic biolab
- Sewing machine industrial normal
- Sewing machine industrial overlock
- **Sewing machine small digital**
- Knitting machine
- Knitting machine electroloom
- Fab Loom
- **Soft actuators - e-textiles (conductive threads, conductive fabrics, mini vibration motors…)**
- **Scissors- threads, yarns, natural fibers**
- **Big working tables ( as fashion schools)**
- Roland Tex-art dye sublimation printer
- Embroidery machine

## Necessary Supplies

- Textiles

- Molding and casting supplies

- Composites supplies

- Cardboard, sheet plywood and other consumable stock materials

- Electronics

## Do I need these specific machines and components?

Yes - you do.

In order to fully participate in the class you will need the materials required. 

In some rare cases, non-Soft Inventory machines may be substituted, but this often causes serious problems for the students as the Academy Gurus are unable to support the unfamiliar machines remotely when things go wrong.

We recommend the machines in the inventory for a reason, we have found them to be reliable, affordable and able to perform the necessary course tasks. Other machine will be considered on a case-by-case basis if your lab applies to be a Soft Academy site (Node) .

It also violates the core Fab principle that "Fab labs share core capabilities, so that people and projects can be shared across them." - Neil Gershenfeld, Fab Lab FAQ

## Local Class Working Groups

What is the maximum / minimum number of students in a local Soft Academy class?

Beyond a Local Instructor, a workgroup of students is required in order to create the necessary collaboration environment for a successful Soft Academy class.

We believe (nearly) impossible for a student to complete the course on their own and workgroup ensures that one student’s strong suit may help make up for another student’s weak spots and vice versa.

Here are the general guidelines for Class Working Groups:

CRITICAL MASS NECESSARY: They are made up of a Local Instructor and at least 3 students or 3+ students and a Remote Guru.

PREVENTING INSTRUCTOR OVERLOAD: Groups larger than approximately 10 students per Local Instructor or Guru are not recommended, simply because there are not enough hours in the weekly cycle for each of those students to receive appropriate guidance from a single individual.

MACHINE LOGISTICS: In the case of multiple Local Instructors / Gurus in one lab, another 5 students can be enrolled for a recommended maximum of 15 students, as the problem now becomes a logistical one of students vs machines and machine time available (assuming standard inventory quantities).

REMOTE LOCATION CONSOLIDATION: Likewise, it is not recommended that Guru support more than 10 remote students and every attempt should be made to group remote students in such a way that Gurus do not have students in more than 2 remote locations.
