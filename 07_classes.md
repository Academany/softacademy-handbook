# Classes

## Class 1 
Digital Human. Digitizing the self

**TASK: use software (make human, scanning, 3d modeling to obtain the body and a digital fabrication process to produce it (the production happens in groups of 3-4)**

## Class 2  
Circular Fashion, open source , upcycling , zero waste clothes, reconfigurable fashion, hacking the fashion industry

**TASK: design and document digital fabricated creation and upload to platform (fablabs.io or intergrated platform ^opensourcefashion^ ) for sharing. Modular reconfigurable systems / assembled garments / seamless fashion.
Keep metrics of it while the duration of the course, use social media to share and track its spreading**
