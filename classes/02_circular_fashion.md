# Class 3: Circular Open Source Fashion

10-10-2017

Zoe Romano

In this class the lecture will outline the systems behind fashion and the textile industry, focusing on alternative systems such as circular fashion, agile fashion, open value chains.

The focus will be on creating modular elements, structures and connections that allow the user to change the shape of a garment, resize it or replace certain elements. Students will publish their creations on open source platforms and learn how to monitor and promote their creations in a distributed network.

** Program outline ** 

- Intro teacher
- Circular fashion
- Hacking the fashion system
- Agile fashion
- Modular elements
- Modular seams
- References

** Tools/software **
- 2d drawing software
- illustrator, rhino3d & grasshopper
- valentina project
- openfitlab
- laser cutter
  
**Materials**

- sealing textiles, synthetic textiles that melt and seal the edges of the cut outs
- vegetable tanned leather (chrome tanned leather is toxic when heated)
- felt, natural and synthetic (preferably pla or other biodegardable felts)
- neoprene (check for composition that no toxic particle/fumes will be released when heated)

**Assignment**

The students will have to design and fabricate a modular reconfigurable system or seamless garments. The soft connection can be designed to be implemented in the assembly of a garment, being applied on the seams or it can be designed as single elements that act as construction parts of a garment. 

The whole process needs to be documented on the personal webpage.

Their task is to upload their open source file, accompanied by a manual of materials and a tutorial of how to make it and track its life throughout the whole course. Keep metrics of it while the duration of the course, use social media to share and track its spreading,.

**How will it be evaluated?**

- document how soft interlocking connection has been designed and fabricated
- how the connection either creates a full garment or has been applied to the seams
- show that the connection is well designed and holds the pull/stretch of a garment
- include all downloadable files in your documentation
