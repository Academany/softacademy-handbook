## INTRODUCTION CLASS

26th September 2017

Anastasia Pistofidou, Cecilia Raspanti, Fiore Basile

In the introduction class we will introduce the team coordinating the academy and contextualize the scope of the program. Highlighting the common values and principles for which the program stands for and the framework in which we will operate. The class will give the students an overview of the main aspects and tools for documenting their work, in order to be able to shape their personal websites. These tools will be put into practice by describing the possible final project and drafting a first sketch of it in their documentation websites.
