### SCIENTIFIC COORDINATION

**Anastasia Pistofidou - FabTextiles / Fab Lab BCN**

Anastasia is a Greek architect specialized in digital fabrication technologies, design and education. She has a Master degree from the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia 2010-2011 with a specialization in Digital tectonics and a Bachelor Degree from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, department of Architecture in 2008. She currently works at the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC) Fab Lab Barcelona as the director and founder of the FabTextiles research lab. She combines the analog and the digital towards applied research focused on new materials, art and textiles.


**Cecilia Raspanti - TextileLab Amsterdam / Waag Society**

Cecilia is a fashion/textile designer and digital fabrication expert. She studied fashion design and knitwear at Polimoda Fashion Institute in Florence, Italy. Currently based in Amsterdam, she is the co-founder of the TextileLab Amsterdam and co-initiator of the educational program TextileAcademy at Waag Society. Here she leads the creative research and technological development of new concepts and alternatives for the textile and clothing industry, which is at the moment part of the TCBL project. Experienced in fashion, knitwear and textiles, she focuses on translating traditional craftsmanship techniques and small production processes into digital fabrication opportunities to facilitate the access of these technologies for a broader public. Always inspired by human’s connection to nature and technology, her latest work involves research towards more sustainable solutions for dyeing in the textile and clothing industry.

**Oscar Tomico**

His main research topic to develop situated practices allowing for a constructive confrontation between the designer’s rationale and societal motivations and values (co-reflection). Current projects focus involving stakeholders during the design process to foster co-operation and reflective practices between participants in order to frame the design space, collaboration space and reformulate their design opportunity. His PhD thesis was on subjective experience gathering techniques for interaction design based on constructivist psychology.
