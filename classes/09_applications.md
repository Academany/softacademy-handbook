(wearable) technology meets (fashion) design: implications and applications

Recent developments in electronics, software programming and service design are shaking the current notions of what a textile is. Societal trends like a renewed interest in crafts, the need for a sustainable mass production system and the emergence of personalization are reshaping the way the fashion system works. By means of a series of conceptual garments and research exemplars carried out at the Wearable Senses Lab at Eindhoven University of Technology, this talk illustrates the challenges and the space of opportunities emerging where (wearable) tech meets (fashion) design. 

** Program ** 

- Relation between craftsmanship, mass production, customization and services 
- Ultra-personalised product service systems (UPPSS): ultra-personalized fashion and connected health
- Personalization at a product level: digital material production 
- Personalization at a systems level: generative design and fit 
- Personalization at a service level: end user programing 
- Case study 1: BB.Suit 0.2 
- Case study 2: Kimbow
- Case study 3: Phototrope

** Assignment **

Individually create a Ultra-personalized product service systems (UPPSS) based on the project you want to develop further as your final project. Make sure that you explore how personalization can happen at more than one level. A customer journey map is expected to be presented the week after where the different levels of personalization are integrated in the design and use of the UPPSS presented.
